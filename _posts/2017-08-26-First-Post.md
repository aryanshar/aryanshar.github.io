title: Finally Started Off...
---



Finally today I started off with things which all will contribute towards my final step. I started off learning what Docker is and how is it better than virtual machines...Also learnt what docker containers are.
2 Days ago I sent my First PR (yay :p) to Coala Organisation.Today it finally got accepted!
I'm looking forward in continuing to contribute towards this organisation and have finally created the required environment for development, like created the coala-env for development and testing purpose.
Also out of interest, i ran into what Saksham told me to try once : CRON JOBS :p .I actually explored what cron jobs are and I guess I can finally write a cron job of my own now. All thanks to saksham _/|\_
